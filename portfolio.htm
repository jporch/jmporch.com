        <p>Technology should enhance our humanity, not distort it. As an experienced software developer, my goal is to create and disseminate quality software that respects the whole person of its users and truly makes their lives better. Such work should be polished, humane, effective, and dependable. As such, I hold myself to a high standard of competence in academic study, personal research, and professional performance. My attention to detail and conscientiousness are both driven by a commitment to excellence and integrity in everything I do.</p>
        <p>Both as a professional developer and a research fellow, I have always sought to integrate all elements of my life. My studies in the realms of anthropology, literature, and philosophy, stem from the idea that the most effective developers must cultivate a strong interest in many things outside math and technology. A life well-lived is an integral part of who I am as a software professional, and I value my non-technical skills just as highly as my professional expertise. Because of this I am well-prepared to focus on the details of implementation while maintaining a firm grasp on the broader meaning of the tasks I undertake.</p>
        <p>Supported by my technical proficiency and commitment to healthy relationships, I aspire to grow in leadership responsibility so that I can contribute to both the creation of exemplary software and to the development of a sustainable culture that supports it.</p>

            <span>As a Research Fellow at <a href="http://trinityfellowsacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TFA</a>, I pursued self-guided research under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symanstevens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Syman Stevens</a> and <a href="https://lauracookkenna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Laura Cook-Kenna</a>. My focus was the anthropological role of play in human society and its applications in the development of videogames. I produced a written thesis and supporting essays published at the online videogame criticism journal <a href="http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/a-review-of-miguel-sicarts-beyond-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Person Scholar</a> as well as the games and culture webzine <a href="https://www.haywiremag.com/columns/playing-for-real-let-there-be-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haywire Magaine</a>. Along with my own research, I served in a writing group with two other Fellows, providing significant feedback, brainstorming, and proofreading for their own research theses.</span>
            <span>On a weekly basis I served as support staff for the <a href="https://www.ospreypoint.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Osprey Point Retreat and Convention Center</a>, learning to develop my hospitality and servant leadership skills under the General Manager, <a href="mailto:rvalentine@ospreypoint.org">Roger Valentine</a>. This work is a fully integrated part of TFA's <a href="https://trinityfellowsacademy.org/about-us/vision-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision</a> for developing the character and attitude needed to truly be a great leader in any field. I also helped to provide this same hospitality and service to lecturers and guests visiting TFA, acted as Logistics Coordinator for three major weekend conferences that the TFA Fellows hosted, and oversaw all work shift scheduling for the year.</span>

Much of my day-to-day efforts were dedicated to supporting multiple mission-critical applications used throughout the company. My tasks ranged from triage and categorization of newly reported bugs to meeting with end users to develop specifications for requested features and enhancements.</span>
            <span>Projects that I contributed to include InterSystems' change control and workflow management application, a facilities management ticketing and issue tracker, a Customer Relations Managment application, and a contractor directory and workflow manager.</span>
            <span>I worked extensively with InterSystems technologies such as Caché , Ensemble, ObjectScript, Zen, and Caché Server Pages (CSP), as well as standard web development technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for client-side functionality and DOM manipulation.</span>
            <span>InterSystems' Change Control Record, a workflow and version control management application I helped develop during my time there, was named the best use of Perforce Helix in Medical Technology (for its use with <a href="https://www.intersystems.com/our-products/trakcare/trakcare-overview-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InterSystems TrakCare</a>) at the <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/and-winners-2016-versionary-awards-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Versionary Awards</a>, presented during the <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/see-full-agenda-merge-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perforce MERGE conference</a>.</span>

            <span>As part of Grove City College's Sweezy Fellowship Research Experience for Undergraduates program, I worked with a team of three other students alongside <a href="http://www.rtvtk.org/~cgribble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Christiaan Gribble</a> pursuing research in ray tracing. The project involved significant experience coding, both within a conventional UNIX environment and for specialized DSP hardware (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Processors,_Inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPI's</a> Storm-I).</span>
            <span>Our efforts saw the successful creation of a fully-functional ray tracing engine to facilite research in both fixed and floating-point environments, as well as a peer-reviewed paper published in the <cite>Journal of Graphics, GPU, and Game Tools</cite> and a poster at <cite>ACM SIGGRAPH/Eurographics High Performance Graphics</cite>. (See <a href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a>)</span>
            <span>My personal contributions involved working on the fixed-point mathematics libraries needed to facilitate our work the the DSP, as well as contributions to the design and implementation of the core ray-tracing engine.
