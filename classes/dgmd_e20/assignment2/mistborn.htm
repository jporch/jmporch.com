      <h1 id="content-heading">The Mistborn Trilogy</h1>
      <p>The Mistborn Trilogy is one of the core works from <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/" title="Link to Branden Sanderson's personal website">Branden Sanderson's</a> Cosmere series of books. The term is actually ambiguous, because the Mistborn world involves more than one trilogy. Presently, there is the "original trilogy" which consists of 3 books: <em>The Final Empire</em>, <em>The Well of Ascension</em>, and <em>The Hero of Ages</em>. There are also three books in the "Wax and Wayne" series, but it is not technically a trilogy because it will eventually be concluded in a fourth book. Branden has also described plans for two more trilogies set in the world of Mistborn, but as of this time neither have been written. This page focuses only on the original (and currently only) trilogy.</p>

      <p><em>The Final Empire</em> introduces us to the world of Scadrial and to the characters Kelsier and Vin. Kelsier is a master thief, recently returned to the capital to pull his biggest job heist. Improving Kelsier's chances are his abilities as a titual "Mistborn," an individual born with "allomancy"&mdash;the ability to draw fantastical powers out of certain metals. Unlike the slightly-more-common "Mistings," who are able to wield the powers of a single metal, the Mistborn can use any of the 10 allomantic metals. To round our his crew of Mistings, Kelsier recruits the orphan Vin, a young Mistborn living on the streets, training her and preparing his crew for the ultimate heist: stealing the world back from the Immortal Emperor.</p>

      <p><em>The Well of Ascension</em> picks up after the successful defeat of the Emperor. While the world is now free of his rule, Vin, along with the rest of Kelsier's Crew, must work to bring stability and order to the world they've liberated. As they struggle to unite the squabbling and scheming nobility and ensure the ongoing prosperity of the world's population, they begin to uncover hints that not everything is as straightforward as it seemed. While the Emperor was undoubtedly cruel and violent, they slowly begin to understand that his actions had far deeper motivations than they assumed, and an ancient power that he'd held at bay for a millenium is beginning to stir once more...</p>

      <p><em>The Hero of Ages</em> concludes the trilogy. Having tried their hand at politics, Vin and her compatriots, including Lord Elend Venture, now race against impending apocalypse to try to understand the true nature of the world. Without the Emperor's influence maintaining the status quo, the world has begun to unravel, and if they can't solve the mystery in time their fledling nation and the world itself are on borrowed time. With the help of old friends and new allies, they build an army to contest the power of Ruin himself as they strive to filfill an ancient prophecy that provides their only glimmer of hope.</p>
