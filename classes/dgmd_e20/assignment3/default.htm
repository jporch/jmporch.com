      <h1 id="content-heading">The Cosmere: An Overview</h1>
      <p>The term "cosmere" originates from the writings of fantasy author <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/" title="Link to Branden Sanderson's personal website">Branden Sanderson.</a> In-universe, the term is the name for the specific form that reality takes; in addition to physical reality, roughly analagous to our own, Sanderson's world also comprises a "Cognitive" realm and a "Spiritual" realm. The term is also used by fans of his works to distinguish between books that are and are not part of this shared universe.</p>

        <h2>Physical Realm</h2>
        <p>Broadly speaking, the <strong>Physical Realm</strong> is what we would consider "normal" reality. It contains planets and stars, many of which are populated by a variety of animals and plants. Under normal conditions, the Physical Realm behaves according to the laws of physics as we tend to understand them. However, many of the worlds that exist within the Cosmere exhibit some sort of magic or power that permits those with the proper abilities and knowledge to influence the Physical Realm, often with dramatic results. While this magic generally involves interaction with one or both of the other two realms, most forms of magic do not actually require the user to fully understand the nature of the realms. Likewise, it is entirely possible for a scholar to be "realmatically aware" and not possess any particular affinity for magic.</p>
        <h2>Cognitive Realm</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Cognitive Realm</strong>--which at least some characters refer to by the name "Shadesmar"--is strongly connected to the Physical Realm, but as the name implies it is based upon mind and thought rather than the "laws of physics." While it does have its own similar natural laws, time and space behave differently within this realm. Interestingly, its geography tends to mimic with Physical Realm for the most part with several key distances. Most immediately obvious is that the land and sea are inverted: inexperienced travelers entering Shadesmar for the first time are likey to find themselves drowning unless they plan their entrance carefully. These seas, however, are not full of water, but of millions of tiny beads, each of which represents the "mind" of a corresponding thing in the Physical Realm. This specifically includes nonsentient objects like sticks or fire, though such minds tend to be very limited and focused on being <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/words-of-radiance-deleted-interlude-stick/" title="link to Words of Radiance 'I am a stick' interlude">a stick</a>, for instance. Another useful difference is that the vast interstellar spaces between worlds are barely present in Shadesmar, which makes it a popular route for traveling between different planets. This difference again stems from the realm's tie to the mind: because space is mostly empty, there is very little thought devoted to it, hence it is barely represented in the Cognitive Realm.</p>
        <h2>Spiritual Realm</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Spirital Realm</strong> is far less understood than the other two, at least by most characters. Rather than being a mirror of the other realms, it exists more or less outside of both time and space, and is the primary source of power for the magical forces that characters in the other realms make use of. The few cases where the Spiritual Realm has been directly observed have demonstrated its tremendous danger: the Cognitive Realm near the world of Sel has been rendered almost uninhabitable due to a large amount of energy from the Spiritual Realm being trapped there. While some characters appear to have a deeper understanding of the Spiritual Realm's nature and function, for most it is either completely unknown or merely viewed as a source of power.</p>
